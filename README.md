# C++ Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains three projects developed for an Algorithms and Data Structures course. Each project demonstrates different concepts in C++ and data structure utilization.

## Projects Overview

1. **Bigint in C++**: An implementation of large integer arithmetic which can handle arithmetic operations on integers larger than the standard integer types in C++.
2. **UNO Game**: A text-based simulation of the popular UNO card game, demonstrating object-oriented programming and effective data structure usage.
3. **Huffman Encoding**: Implementation of Huffman encoding algorithm for efficient data compression, showcasing the use of binary trees and priority queues.

## 1. Bigint in C++

### Description

The Bigint project involves creating a class that can store and perform arithmetic operations on integers larger than the `long long` data type in C++. It's particularly useful for applications that require handling of very large numbers, such as in cryptography or scientific calculations.

### Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Basic understanding of operator overloading

### Usage

Include the `bigint.h` in your project and use the `Bigint` class for arithmetic operations.

## 2. UNO Game

### Description

This project simulates the UNO card game in a console application. It utilizes various object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with data structures like vectors and queues.

### Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Familiarity with the rules of the UNO game

### How to Play

Run the executable and follow the on-screen instructions to play the game in a text-based interface.

## 3. Huffman Encoding

### Description

Huffman Encoding project demonstrates a simple text compression and decompression algorithm using Huffman coding. It efficiently encodes data by assigning variable-length codes to characters, with shorter codes for more frequent characters.

### Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Understanding of binary trees and priority queues

### Usage

Use the Huffman encoding algorithm to compress and decompress text data. The implementation provides functions for both processes.
